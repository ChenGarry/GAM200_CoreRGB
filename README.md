<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

In this project, we build our custom engine game with ECS design. I learned how to utilize data oriented designed system. I also honored to be promote to tech lead due to pervious tech lead dropping the class.

The game's original goal is a "top-down resource-based shooter," but we were caught up in making systems we lost time to improve the gameplay element. However, I gained tremendous among of technical experience making this project. 

### Built With

This project was build with custom ECS engine intergrated with following 3rd party libraries.

* [OpenGL glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/)
* [RTTR](https://www.rttr.org/)
* [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/)

* serialization system using RTTR
* component system template 
* Entity management system
* various enemy behavior
* weapon behaviors suiting for both player and enemy 
* wave spawning system with json support

List of things I did as tech lead.

* establishing coding stander 
* helped refactoring object oriented collision system into ECS designed engine
